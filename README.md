# sensiblecare

Here's the app for Sensible Care.  You'll need to create the database with the .sql file included--that will also insert 5 rows.  I ran out of time before I was able to add in the logic to remove expired point data or create any tests.  There is also currently a JSON error in the console.  Thanks!
